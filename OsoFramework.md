# Why OsoFramework #

Because my dog looks like a bear. And also it rhymes with Mono and Awesome.


## What OsoFramework offers ##
  * Easy to parse XHTML pages
  * Fast way to save extracted data to databases (SQLite, SQL Server, MySql)
  * LINQ extensions for XDocument allows easy to parse HTML tags
  * Text search tag converter when HTML is hard to parse.
  * Extensive logging support

## Future support ##

Probably it will be expanded with:
  * Dynamic LINQ to have queries configure
  * Web Management for executing robots and monitoring
  * Support for non XML based data (JSON)
